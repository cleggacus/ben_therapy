    about_me: `I am a trained and experienced psychotherapist who offers a warm, safe and supportive space to explore your past, present and future within a therapeutic relationship that you will feel really seen and heard in.  I am a Registrant Member of the National Counselling and Psychotherapy Society (NCPS) and on their register that has been accredited by the Professional Standards Authority.  I adhere to the NCPS Code of Ethical Practice.
I offer you a safe space in a world lacking safe spaces for many.
I have trained in Integrative Psychotherapy and as such use an approach tailored to you, as our relationship emerges for both of us in the sessions. I integrate creativity and play as well as the conventional ideas you may have about therapy.
At some point in our lives, we all experience feelings of anxiety, sadness, depression, panic or anger. You might think something is intrinsically wrong with you, but you cannot put your finger on it.
Psychotherapy is one way to explore and understand what you are experiencing and gain insight into how to move forward. I believe the most important aspect of therapy is the quality and depth of the relationship between therapist and client. This ensures effective therapy and can facilitate meaningful change.  I am not a blank canvass or silent observer and so can be authentically with and alongside you as we genuinely work together through your process of change.
I offer long-term, short-term, online and telephone therapy and work with a range of issues, including but not limited to, anxiety, depression, bereavement, relationship and identity issues.
A particular interest I hold is in exploring how young adults/adults relate to and define masculinity in a rapidly moving and demanding society. Fluidity in gender and sexuality raise the question; how is it for young men to navigate non-binary and gender fluidity as opposed to the 'Andrew Tate' idea of masculinity?
I also have an interest in working with trauma and work to provide my clients with the tools to navigate their relationships better and aim to provide a warm, safe environment from which the client can explore their thoughts and feelings in more depth.
I trained through Middlesex University and Metanoia Institute, one of the leading psychotherapy training institutes in the UK, achieving a Postgraduate Diploma (level 7) in Integrative Psychotherapy.
I have worked in private practice since 2019 and right now see clients in person at Kensal Rise and via Zoom.
I have worked in various counselling settings including long-term therapy as well as South London & Maudsley NHS in GP practices delivering short-term referral services.
I understand engaging with therapy can be intimidating and potentially anxiety inducing. This is why I offer a free 30 min introductory call to empower you to see if we are a good match. Therapist and client is an important relationship and so I will regularly reflect with you on the direction of our therapeutic endeavour.`,
    fees: `I offer a free 30 minute initial phone consultation - during this call we can go through any questions you might have, and we can explore how I might be able to support you in your journey. I recognise that making the first step is often the hardest, so please feel free to contact me.
Following on from the initial consultation, we can then arrange a first session. During the first session I will talk and ask more questions than I will in the following sessions. The reason for this is so I can gain a sense of your background, hopes for therapy and ultimately how we can work together to support you in living a fuller life. Should we both feel that there is a good fit then we can plan for future sessions.
Sessions are 50 minutes in length and are on the same day, at the same time, weekly. Weekly therapy sessions create a certain level of intensity and commitment ensuring counselling is at its most effective.
The fee for individual therapy is £70 (50 minute session). 
I do have some (limited) low cost slots available, please contact me for more information.`,
